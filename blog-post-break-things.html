        <h2>Why We Break Things</h2>
        <h4>May 2025 | Runebreak Collective</h4>
        <p> 
            We don’t build worlds to keep them pristine. We build them to fracture.
        <p>
            At Runebreak Collective, our design philosophy starts with tension—between beauty and decay, 
            ritual and rebellion, silence and signal. Whether we’re crafting a garden care brand or a tactical 
            RPG about broken oaths, we’re always chasing the moment where something cracks… and something new emerges.
        </p>
        <h2>From Branding to Worldbuilding</h2>
        <p> 
            Our roots are in visual storytelling. We’ve built identities for everything from indie game studios 
            to moss-covered service brands. But the leap into game development wasn’t a pivot—it was a natural evolution. 
            Games are brands with lore. Interfaces with emotion. Systems with soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Ash & Oath, we asked:
        </p>
        <p> 
            What if magic was memory? <br>
            What if every spell was a promise—and every promise had a price?
        </p>
        <p>
            That question became the spine of our first major title. And it’s reshaping how we think about design.
        </p>

        <h2>Designing with Consequence</h2>
        <p>
            We don’t do “flavor text.” We do emotional architecture. In Ash & Oath, every mechanic—from terrain manipulation to 
            faction alignment—is tied to the vows you forge, break, or rewrite. The UI isn’t just functional—it’s ceremonial. 
            The combat isn’t just tactical—it’s moral.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re currently refining:
            <ul>
                <li>The Oathbinding System — where abilities are shaped by carved promises</li>
                <li>Faction Rituals — each covenant has its own visual language and gameplay consequences</li>
                <li>Vowbreaking Cinematics — short, symbolic sequences triggered by betrayal</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            We’re experimenting with a modular UI that evolves as your character does—etched bone, scorched parchment, 
            glowing glyphs. We’re also building out Signal Orchard, 
            a surreal puzzle-exploration game where nature is a network and memory is a frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for walking with us. 
            Whether you’re here for the code, the color, or the covenant, we’re glad you found your way to the fracture.
