        <h2>Forging Ash & Oath</h2>
        <h4>September 2025 | Runebreak Collective</h4>
        <p> 
            In a world blanketed by falling ash and fractured memory, we asked ourselves: 
            What if magic wasn’t cast—but kept? 
            What if every spell was a promise, and every promise had a price?
        </p>
        <p>
            That question became the heartbeat of Ash & Oath, our tactical RPG steeped in ritual, 
            consequence, and emotional weight. From the first sketch of a rune-carved bone to the 
            final boss towering over a crumbling sanctuary, this project has been about building a world 
            where power is personal—and memory is dangerous.
        </p>
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p> 
            We didn’t want flashy spell effects or generic fantasy tropes. 
            We wanted ritual. Every mechanic in Ash & Oath is built around the idea of 
            Oathbinding—a system where players forge, break, or rewrite magical vows that shape their abilities, 
            relationships, and the world itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combat isn’t just tactical—it’s moral. Terrain shifts, factions evolve, 
            and enemies adapt based on the promises you’ve kept… or betrayed.
        </p>

        <h2>Worldbuilding Through Decay</h2>
        <p>
            The visual direction was clear from the start: stark silhouettes, glowing runes, 
            and a palette of ash, ember, and bone. We leaned into graphic minimalism to 
            make every scene feel like a fragment of myth—weathered, symbolic, and haunting.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the Rune Tree to the Riftlands, each biome tells a story of broken covenants and lingering gods.
             And yes, the final boss? 
            A forgotten deity born of fractured memory and burning regret. You’ll know when you see it.
        </p>
        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            We’re currently refining the vowbreaking cinematic system, where your choices trigger
             unique visual sequences tied to the covenants you’ve defied. 
            We’re also experimenting with a bone-carved UI that evolves as your oaths do—etched, 
            scorched, and sacred.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for following along. Whether you’re a fellow dev, a lore nerd, or just someone who loves a good ruin, we’re glad you’re here. The ash remembers. And the gods are listening.
